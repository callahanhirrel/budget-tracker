# budget-tracker
A Flask application designed for real time tracking of budgets and funding for college/university academic departments.

This application is primarily intended to be used by administrative assistants, department chairs, and department professors.

Big user goals include:
* viewing funding distribution for a department in *real time*
* access to an archive of budget data to make predictions and be prepared for cyclic expenses
* editing database itself, adding, removing, editing fields

Other long term goals include development of an API and mobile-frontend to allow users to view this data from a mobile app.

*This application was started as a Computer Science Senior Capstone Project by Callahan Hirrel at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu)*
